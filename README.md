# TobyLearn
Made as an alternative to the increasingly commercial Quizlet, this program aims to provide a simple and efficient learning experience without paywalls or unnecessary distractions.


## Roadmap
- More integration with operating system (drag and drop sets, ...)
- Accent buttons
- Choice of case/accent sensitivity

Example .tl file:
```json

  "huis": "maison",
  "auto": "voiture",
  "boek": "livre",

  "tafel": "table",
  "stoel": "chaise"
}
```
