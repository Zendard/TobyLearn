# TobyLearn
Made as an alternative to the increasingly commercial Quizlet, this program aims to provide a simple and efficient learning experience without paywalls or unnecessary distractions.


## Roadmap

- GUI for creating sets
- More integration with operating system (drag and drop sets, ...)
- Accent buttons
- Choice of case/accent sensitivity


## Creating sets
Currently there is no GUI for creating sets but instead it is done by creating a .tl file and editing it with a text editor

Example .tl file:
```json
{
  "question": "answer",

  "huis": "maison",
  "auto": "voiture",
  "boek": "livre",
  "fiets": "v√©lo",
  "tafel": "table",
  "stoel": "chaise"
}
```
